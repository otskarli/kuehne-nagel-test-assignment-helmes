## Suggestions for UI improvements
* Product view should not be outside the actual container, for responsive side it is hard to position, even smaller screens.
* Clicking on the product, the item should have a popup initially, or new page, or even animate bigger in height 
(to see more information)
* The list should have initial values rendered or some kind of "show all products" checkbox
* Category filter has to be dropdown, something like select2, lets say, there are 50 categories, then half of the page 
would be a list of categories
* Keyup on search should be handled with submit button, so we don't make unnecessary calls to backend
* There is no point to have disabled tabs, it confuses users
